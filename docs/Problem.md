# The problems during FIP treatment

## FIP overview

FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis) is a **serious and often fatal disease** that affects cats 😿.
[More info about FIP](https://ccah.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk4586/files/inline-files/Summary%20of%20GS-441524%20treatment%20v5.pdf)

Until recently, it was considered untreatable, leaving cat owners devastated with little to no options for saving their loving pets.

However, with the advent of new treatments and medications, managing FIP is now possible. 💉🐱

### Problems

- keeping track of temperature, weight, activity, appetite, clinical signs
  of original disease at daily or weekly intervals
- blood tests at the beginning of the treatment and every 4 weeks therafter
- treatment duration is very long (84 days or more) so keeping track of everything above can be pretty difficult and exhausting for both cat and owner
- if treatment is not tracked, there is a possibilty of incorrect dosage, missed medications and relapse

As a fellow cat lover who has personally cared for multiple FIP positive cats at the same time, I created this app to help others going through the same experience.
